\section{..}
\begin{itemize}
\item talk about using azure ml 
\item did covid have an influence
\item would results be better split on a property level
\item Talk about how feature visualization can be used within the company CRM to identify important attributes 
\item how results compare with similar papers in revenue management 
\item as a classification problem and my highlighting the features that cause cancellations I hope to be able to integrate results into the PMS system and take specific actions aimed at preventing bookings from being canceled by using personalized data specific to the individual booking
\end{itemize}



\section{What went wrong}
\begin{itemize}
\item Focusing on the accuracy of the model not the precision and True True to True False ratio. This meant when looking at how many bookings I correctly predicted as cancelled it was fairly low
\item This is important because there is not much value in predicting false as this is the expected outcome and when I was looking at the results precision and recall scores included the prediction of False values
\item Meaning the actual accuracy of the model is actually around 60-70 
\end{itemize}



\section{Next Time}
\begin{itemize}
\item Splitting the dataset to a country or property level I think would make the results more accurate since many of the similarities and correlations in the data set occur when looking at the data split to each country
\item include some images to support this 
\item doing this would require training multiple different models and ensuring and adequate size dataset is available for each property to prevent the data set from over fitting
\item  feature engineering, are some features not reinvent. remove things that are noise. separate variable for each unique categorical variable 
\end{itemize}
