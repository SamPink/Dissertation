\chapter*{\center \Large  Abstract}

A major problem of revenue management, which exists in almost all booking industries, is the customer's right to cancel the booking before it has been paid; this is equally prevalent in the student accommodation industry. Being able to predict with high accuracy which bookings are going to be cancelled helps to reduce uncertainty and increase revenue. This research was initially started by the aviation industry and has slowly moved into other fields, like the hotel industry. Despite this, there are still a large number of industries that are yet to take advantage of this revenue management strategy. Using a real dataset from the student accommodation industry it has been shown that it is possible to predict with 71 percent recall whether or not an individual booking is going to be cancelled using a machine learning classification model. Results demonstrate that it is not only possible to predict with high accuracy if a booking is going to be cancelled, but it is also possible to identify what specific attributes in the booking cause the cancellation to occur through model explanation. Doing this allows for a more accurate prediction of demand management and revenue forecasting to be made as well as the ability to use this information to prevent bookings from being cancelled.
