\chapter*{\center \Large  Abstract}

In the student accommodation industry, when a booking is made the customer has the right to cancel their booking before it is paid, this is a problem of revenue management that exists in almost all booking industries. Being able to predict with high accuracy which bookings are going to be cancelled helps to reduce uncertainty and increase revenue. This research was initially started by the aviation industry and has slowly moved into other fields, like the hotel industry. Despite this, there are still a large number of industries that are yet to take advantage of this revenue management strategy. Using a real dataset from the student accommodation industry it has been shown that it is possible to predict with 71 percent recall accuracy whether or not an individual booking is going to be cancelled using a machine learning classification model. Results demonstrate that it is not only possible to predict with high accuracy if a booking is going to be cancelled, but it is also possible to identify what specific attributes in the booking cause the cancellation to occur through model explanation. Doing this allows for a more accurate prediction of demand management and revenue forecasting to be made as well as the ability to use this information to prevent bookings from being cancelled.
