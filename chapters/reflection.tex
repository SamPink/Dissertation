Throughout this project I have learnt how to implement my knowledge of machine learning into a real world example by using a classification model to solve a business problem of predicting booking cancellations.Doing so has given me a greater understanding of how to judge a model's results, as I used to focus solely on model accuracy, assuming that a model with a higher accuracy score was better. I now understand that it is important to gain a deeper understand of why a specific accuracy score is given by looking at the results from the confusion matrix.

I learnt to use a new tool, Auto ML studio, which I believe helped to improve my ability to create and implement machine learning predictions though providing infrastructure that allowed me to easily evaluate and compare many different algorithms.

I found that I was able to solve my original objective by predicting with 71 percent recall if a booking is going to be cancelled, this is significant as previously there was no research looking at bookings in the student accommodation industry. I think the application of machine learning into industries that are yet to take advantage of it can provide a lot of value since there are only a few industries that have been properly able to take advantage of these new tools available in computer science. One of the reasons for this is the complexity involved in the many stages that make up a machine learning project, I believe by taking advantage of Auto ML studio the complexity of solving this problem is reduced.
