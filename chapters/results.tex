looking at the above figure we can see the feature with most influence on the Target variable is installment type, specifically instalment type customised. This is supported by figure [\textbf{something}] that show students with the instalment type customized are far less likely to cancel. The second most important feature of nationality United Kingdom is likely a dependant feature because the majority of bookings are made by students from the United Kingdom. 
\textbf{i think add a figure to methodology for nationality}
Degree type other being an influencing factor is also supported by figure [\textbf{something}] since students with degree type other where around twice as likely to cancel bookings.
