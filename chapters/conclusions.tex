\section{Conclusions}
The final model accuracy gives a score  of 83 percent, this is consistent with the results of [references] and shows that it is in fact possible to predict booking cancellations with relatively high accuracy using PMS data in the context of student accommodation. 

\section{Future Work}
implementing my model into the PMS system I hope to be able to highlight customers on a daily basis who are most likely to cancel there bookings through a ranking system, using the models feature explanation I should be able to identify the reason why this customer has been selected as most likely to cancel there booking and with the provide a recommended set of messages to send the customer in an attempt to prevent the cancellation from occurring.

With a clean dataset in place that encapsulates the customers data I think I can extend the predictive capabilities beyond predicting cancellations to predicting what new properties will be most profitable in the feature to assist in company decisions of which properties to buy and which to sell.

\begin{itemize}
\item expand machine learning into all decision areas of company
\end{itemize}
