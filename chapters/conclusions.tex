\section{Conclusions}


The final model accuracy gives a score of 71 percent true positive bookings, this is consistent with the results of \cite{Antonio2017PredictingRevenue} when looking at recall and shows that it is in fact possible to predict booking cancellations with relatively high accuracy using PMS data in the context of student accommodation. Proving  machine learning can be applied using Azure Auto ML studio to solve regression problems using already existing data sets if care is taken in the data preparation stages, this is the benefit of using the CRISP-DM methodology to break down the problem into a series of well defined stages to solve a specific example of a generic problem.
